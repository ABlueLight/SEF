# SEF
This is PyTorch implementation of our paper ["Learning Semantically Enhanced Feature for Fine-Grained Image Classification"](about:blank). We experimented on 4 fine-grained benchmark datasets --- CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars, Stanford Dogs, and VGG-Aircraft. You should first download these datasets from their project homepages before runing SEF.
